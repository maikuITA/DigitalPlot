## ‚û§ The perfect site for every reader

**DigitalPlot** is a web application developed for a university project. It allows users to write and read articles published by other users in a simple and accessible way.

In our application, there are four main types of users:
- **BASIC**: This user can read up to eight articles, earn points for each article read, and purchase a subscription.
- **READER**: This user can read all articles on the website. Additionally, he can write reviews, follow specific writers, and search for specific articles on the website.
- **WRITER**: This user has the same features as the Reader, with an additional privilege: he can post, modify, and delete his own articles.
- **ADMIN**: The Admin is the all-mighty user. He can manage every article on the website, and every article must be approved by him. He can also view log files and delete comments.

## ‚û§ üöÄ Installation Guide

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- PHP (version 8.x or higher)
- A web server (e.g. Apache)
- A relational DBMS (e.g. MariaDB)
- Composer

After downloading the repository to your device, follow these steps:

### 1. Extract the folder
Extract all the folder files into the document root of your server (e.g.: xampp/htdocs if you are using xampp)

### 2. Install dependencies

Open your terminal in the document root folder and run:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure database

Edit the database settings in the following file:
```
/Progetto/Utility/config.php
```
Be sure to set your host, database name, username, and password properly.<br>

### 4. Enjoy our application

If you are using a local server be sure to:
- Comment the line 26 of the file '.htaccess';
- Grant Apache permission to read and write in the following directories: proxy, template_c, and Logs. Otherwise, the application will not function correctly.

After that, start your local server (e.g. with php artisan serve if using Laravel, or configure Apache/Nginx) and access the application via your browser by typing the URL hostname/dbInit in order to populate properly your db (at the end, you will be redirected to the home). <br>

N.B. 
- If you see an error message after browsing to dbInit, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis is normal. The database is working correctly, just reload the page and you will be redirected to the home page;
- The automatic redirect to HTTPS may not work in all browsers because the certificate is missing. However, if you click 'Proceed anyway', the redirect will still occur. Otherwise, to solve this problem comment the line 20-21-22 of the file 
'.htaccess'.
